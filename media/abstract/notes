questions:
the records will be shown in public automatically when the rdco approved the records? or should I make an option so that the rdco can make it public or not

Do we need to classify the records per course?

if yes, does this mean, the record must only be for the students? should it be identified per authors course? or per records course?

do the upload type needs to be classified? if yes, how can it be classified if it can be inputted manually from the "if others, pls. specify"

will the adviser be able to remove accounts?

do we need to add another account for TBI?
or can we just get the data from another system?

upload by per account? or user?

ISSUES

remove button will not show when the record is already approved
cannot be editted if approved

add approved records and declined records onadviser's profile

add another column for declined records for who specifically declined the record

ITSO has ktto role minus upgrading of account

commercialization and community extension. forms? or just comments?
