                              ======================================

  
  
  ==========================
  1.) HEADQUARTERS CASTLE
  =======================================================================
  CHARACTERS: HUAN, LEKNAAT, LUC, VIKTOR, FLIK, LEONA, BARBARA, FITCHER
  =======================================================================

  in the battle with Solon Jhee then and you'll head to the main hall and Shu, Viktor and Flik
  and the others congratulates you in well done battle and then Shu suggest for a new leader
  and Shu choose Hero to be the new leader because he is the son of the Hero Genkaku and have
  the same bright shield rune in his arm and then Shu will explain more why you should become a
  leader and after that Viktor tells you to meet him in the tavern and talk about Genkaku but
  for now lets relax and rest. in the night you'll wake up with Nanami then head to the tavern
  to talk with Viktor about Genkaku then he'll say that the story is not a good story.
 
  [1]&quot;I still want to hear it.&quot; (let him tell you the story)
  [2]&quot;Forget about it.&quot; (forget about the story)

  Then choose the first answer and Viktor tell you the Story of Genkaku that 30 years Highland
  and the State fought a great war against each other and it seems the State started the war.
  Anabelle's father Mayor Darell of Muse, led the state and the famous general, Han Cunningham,
  led the Highland Army. then Viktor says that Darell was an amateur when it came to war and
  that was the time that Genkaku appeared then Genkaku got command of a unit and raided
  Highland's supply tent and slow down the highland, so that the State will recover their army.
  Genkaku and Han were from the same village and a they are goods friends, he And Han worked
  together to make a peace treaty and all agrees except for one man, the Mayor of Muse city.
  There was one border city, your home town of Kyaro, that Darell refused to give over to
  Highland and so the negotiations broke down and the new war was started, so the King of
  Highland, Agares Blight, made a suggestion that the war should be decided by a duel between
  both Champions and then Both leaders agree and the time came for the duel to begin then King
  Agares gave his sword to Han and Darell gave his the Genkaku, But Genkaku never once raised
  his sword and Darell ordered him to fight over and over, but he refused, with no other
  choice, Han knocked away Genkaku's blade and won the duel, then Viktor says that &quot;that is why
  the town of Kyaro came to be Highland territory and then Genkaku was exile by Lord Darell and
  left without revealing the true reason for not fighting, Many years passed, Darell left his
  Job as a mayor and learned why Genkaku had refused to fight, Darell secretly coated the sword
  with poison, Viktor says that Genkaku was ruined whether he won or lost. if he lost, fine.
  if he won, Darell was planning to expel him for his 'evil crime'. Genkaku detected the poison
  and couldn't bring himself to swing his sword and so Genkaku's name was cleared, but he would
  never again return to the City-State and then after the story then you'll go to sleep and in
  the morning go to the main hall and talk to Shu then he'll ask you if you made up your mind.

  [1]&quot;If you think I can do it....&quot; (agree)
  [2]&quot;There's no way I can do it.&quot; (he'll ask you again)

  Then Huan enters the castle and helps you in your battle with the highland and then he'll

  ask you if this place is North window.
 
  [1]&quot;Nope. You're way off.&quot; (tell him he's in the wrong place)
  [2]&quot;That's right.&quot; (tell him the truth)

  So choose the second answer and then he'll ask about the Hero who defeated Solon Jhee
  from the highland army.

  [1]&quot;He is so unbelievably cool.&quot; (praise your self)
  [2]&quot;Eh, he's nothing special.&quot; (be humble and stay low profile)
  [3]&quot;The hero is me.&quot; (he'll think that your joking)

  After that he'll run off and after that go to the main hall and you'll see Fitcher is talking
  with Shu and then he'll know the truth about you and ask for forgiveness of his poor 
  judgement in a character the he'll ask you to Two rivers city to forge an alliance.

  [1]&quot;Forget about it.&quot; (you'll be ask again)
  [2]&quot;Let's go to Two River.&quot; (agree with him)

  option you'll save him from the punishment then Fitcher introduces you to Ridley and then
  Ridley ask if you are the one who defeated the highland army.

  [1]&quot;Of course, I'm me.&quot;
  [2]&quot;Well you see......&quot;

  Then choose the first answer to tell the truth and Ridley did not buy the proof but Fitcher
  then says that he has the same rune like the hero Genkaku has in his right arm the bright
  shield rune then after that Ridley believe now that your the Hero then Ridley give you
  permission to enter and then Fitcher thank you for coming on time to save him from the lashes
  then he'll join as a convoy and head to the office where you'll meet Makai then Makai greets
  you.

  [1]&quot;Glad to meet you.&quot;
  [2]&quot;What's a 'plenipotentiary'?&quot;

  It doesn't matter which you choose then talks a lot and ask you to join them to defeat the
  highland and then he'll ask of the incident.

  [1]&quot;Umm... My wallet...&quot;
  [2]&quot;There's no need for worry.&quot;

  Also doesn't matter and then he says something about the wingers then let you stay at the
  inn and Fitcher escorts you in the inn and when you go up stairs in the inn you see Hans.

  ----------------------
  RECRUIT (HANS)
  ----------------------

  When you see Hans in the first room talk to him and he'll say that he has a problem about
  finding a place for his armor shop then talk to him again.

  [1]&quot;Come to our castle.&quot; (let him join)
  [2]&quot;That's to bad.....&quot; (feel sorry for him)

  Then he'll ask you who you are and you then you'll tell him about you and he'll join the
  group.

  Then go to the next room were you'll see Chaco, talk to him and ask you if your the leader
  of the army.
  
  [1]&quot;Yeah, that's right.&quot; (tell the truth)
  [2]&quot;I don't have to answer you.&quot; (don't tell him)

  So the truth and then he'll say that he does not believe you and tell you that he ate 
  your dinner for you and flies off to the window and in the morning  you'll see Fitcher and
  he'll to you that their is a terrible news and let you come with him to the assembly him. and
  in the assembly hall you'll see Makai and Ridley fighting over a highland spy.

  [1]&quot;..................&quot;
  [2]&quot;What happened.&quot;
  
  It doesn't matter and after Ridley see's you then he walks out the hall then Makai ask you to
  go to Ridley and ask him to join up with him again.

  [1]&quot;I can't do that.&quot;
  [2]&quot;I understand.&quot;

  So choose the second answer and go to the Kobold district next town the wingers district and
  after your in the Kobold village, you'll be not permitted to enter the district and so head 
  back and then Chaco will steal the wallet of Fitcher and runs off and Fitcher wants to get
  his wallet back, so catch him again and after you cornered him again then he'll open a gate
  and escape to the tunnel then follow him and head down to the tunnel.

       terrible war.&quot;
   
GUSTAV: &quot;Well, at least now there's one less enemy threatening city-state soil.&quot;

TERESA: &quot;But we still don't have true peace in these lands. Lord Hero, there is
        something we wish to ask of you.&quot;

TERESA: &quot;Lord Hero, there's still Harmonia to the north of here and so we can't
        yet completely relax.&quot;

TERESA: &quot;Furthermore, because there was no trust between us, Luca Blight able to
        divine the city-state. 
   
TERESA: &quot;We need a single, unified country. one that can stand together against
        it's enemies.&quot;

TERESA: &quot;Lord Hero, we want you to create a new country here, [name] country, and
        we want you to lead it.&quot;

MAKAI: &quot;This matter was voted and approved by Two River's three houses of parliament.&quot;

GUSTAV: &quot;If it means a stronger nation able to defend itself, we have no
        objections either.&quot;

MIKLOTOV: &quot;The knightdom of Matilda is no more, but we will follow your orders in
          this matter, Lord Hero.&quot;
  
CAMUS: &quot;I feel the same way as Miklotov.&quot;

JESS: &quot;Most of the strength of Muse was stolen by Luca Blight, but we still haven't
      lost our pride as the center of the state.&quot;
  
JESS: &quot;As acting mayor of Muse, I also intend to follow the will of Lord Hero.&quot;

HERO: [1]&quot;I understand.&quot;
      [2]&quot;. . . . . . . . . .&quot;
      [3]&quot;I can't do it.&quot;

[NOTE: choose the third option.]

JOWY: &quot;Just like you promised.... Here we are... Here once again...&quot;

JOWY: &quot;This is where our journey began. You and I walked along the same path for so long
      together but this where they began to diverge...&quot;

JOWY: &quot;But... I have no regrets.&quot;

JOWY: &quot;But if I did, it would be that I had to betray the city-state and assasinate Lady
      Anabelle.&quot;

JOWY: &quot;You and I were a lot alike..... We were both aiming for the same thing,
      But I just....&quot;

JOWY: &quot;At the highland camp, after I let you both escape ahead, I was captured and met
      Luca Blight again.&quot;

JOWY: &quot;I hated him from the beginning, It's true but I think I admired his strength a
      little bit too....&quot;

JOWY: &quot;I thought if I was that strong, I could protect everyone and I could dreate a
      gentle world where nobody would ever be hurt.&quot;

JOWY: &quot;But...&quot;
 
JOWY: &quot;No... Forget about it.&quot;

JOWY: &quot;This is a battle between the King of highland and the leader of the [name] army.
      This is truely... the final battle.&quot;

JOWY: &quot;If we hadn't run away then.....&quot;

SHU: &quot;Then we'd have problems, because without you two, we wouldn't

     one day you'll com back.&quot;

SHU: &quot;There's just on thing I have left to report.&quot;

SHU: &quot;Although I was asked not to tell you until this point. I'll

NANAMI: &quot;Yes...&quot;

NANAMI: &quot;I... I... I'm thinking about getting away from Hero for a while.&quot;

NANAMI: &quot;I know... I know that, but... But it's hard for me...
         Hero and Jowy fighting...&quot;

NANAMI: &quot;Also it's hard for me to see Hero in pain....&quot;

NANAMI: &quot;When there were arrows raining down on us and Hero tried to
        shield me with his body, I realized it...&quot;

NANAMI: &quot;Hero shouldn't do such thing. He's too important for that....&quot;

SHU: &quot;A leader of men can't behave like that.&quot;

NANAMI: &quot;That's... that's why I'm going to let you have him all to yourself for a while.&quot;

SHU: &quot; What will you do?&quot;

NANAMI: &quot;I'll go back to Granpa Genkaku's house. I think It's safe and beside...&quot;

NANAMI: &quot;beside... when this is all over, that kid will need a place
        to return home to right?&quot;

NANAMI: &quot;Also.... I have a favor to ask. If it's ever time for Hero to come home,
        tell him about this conversation.&quot;

SHU: &quot;Why do you ask ME to do it?&quot;

NANAMI: &quot;Because I fegured if it's you, you'd never tell him until it
        was absolutely necessary...&quot;

SHU: &quot;Yeah, you're right... I'll do it.&quot;

[NOTE: After the scene.]

	SECRET #2:
	-----------
	&quot;Thanks to the heavy armor that Humphrey wears in combat,

	know what I mean.&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #3:
	-----------
	&quot;General Kiba's first battle was for the defense of Fort
	Retto. He led a small force of 100 men and managed to

	die sometime. All of them except for the coven mistress,
	Sierra, that is......&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #4:
	-----------
	&quot;Sounds like she's got no plans to go back to her village,

	Position: Strategist's retinue
	Note: None
	-----------
	SECRET #2:
	-----------
	&quot;With the way she's been following Flik around, she
	would teach me a thing or two about investigation
	techniques.&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #3:
	-----------
	&quot;She's a stubborn little fireplug all right. Ain't
	nothing gonna stand in her way.&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #4:

	Note: Seeking revenge on Neclord.
	-----------
	SECRET #2:
	-----------
	&quot;His hometown was destroyed by that Neclord guy.
	That's why he's always traveling. It seems he was
	on an errand in South Window when Neclord came,
	and so he was the only survivor.&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #3:
	-----------
	&quot;When Viktor got back to his village, everyone had
	been turned into bloodthirsty zombies. They were all
	eating each other. Blech!&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #4:
	-----------
	&quot;I don't know exactly who that Daisy was. Maybe his
	little sister, maybe his lover... There's no one left
	to tell me and Viktor ain't talking either...

	Muse, but if ya ask me, he ain't got the stones
	for it...&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #3:
	-----------
	&quot;At least half of his dummy act is a put-on to
	make people underestimate him. It's his strategy.&quot;
	-----------	
	SECRET #4:
	-----------
	&quot;Fitcher can sleep with his eyes wide open. that
	would be a useful trick when ya gotta listen to
	some bore running off at the mouth.&quot;

	&quot;Flik's from Warrior's Village. Their custom is that
	a young man has to go on a journey to complete his
	'Manhood Ritual'. Flik is in the middle of that 
	journey, but he doesn't plan to returning to the
	village.&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #3:
	-----------
	&quot;While he was on his journey to manhood, he met Odessa
	and she changed his life forever. Odessa became first

	first lieutenant.&quot;
	-----------

	-----------

	-----------
	&quot;All he eats for breakfast is a single croissant.
	He's a real weirdo, that one.&quot;
	-----------

	Moon Empire, he was 1 of the 6 Generals. In the

	Falena he was a Royal Knight. He just threw it
	all away.&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #3:
	-----------
	&quot;You'd never know by looking at him, but that old
	man loves sweets. I watched him put away 3 pieces 
	of cheesecake in about 5 minutes...&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #4:
	-----------
	&quot;He can't go back to Falena because he's wanted for
	the crime of murdering the Queen. What the hell could 
	have happened back there...&quot;

	-----------
	&quot;He's after the secrets of the Sindar, but it seems
	he was also a prisoner in the Queendom of Falena for
	several years before you met up with him.&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #3:
	-----------
	&quot;Apparently that look of his is the custom where he
	was born. Something to do with the legendary 
	'Crimson Bird' from his native culture.&quot;

	&quot;Rina and Eilie are sisters, but they're as

	sophisticated, a real adult. You'd never know 
	they were only a year apart.&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #3:

	Position: Royal Guard
	Note: None
	-----------
	SECRET #2:
	-----------
	&quot;She's been traveling ever since she left the
	Grasslands. As far as her knife-throwing goes, she's
	the real deal all right.&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #3:
	-----------
	&quot;She's got a big inferiority complex towards her
	big sister. Who can blame her? After all, Rina is
	so much sexier.&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #4:
	-----------
	&quot;She's got a thing for you, all right. She's always
	worried about you when you head off into combat...&quot;

	used to be in the circus, but he ran away. That's
	when he met Eilie and Rina.&quot;
	-----------	
	SECRET #3:
	-----------
	&quot;He learned that fire-breathing trick in the circus.
	But what kind of circus uses magical runes anyway?&quot;
	-----------
	SECRET #4:
	-----------
	&quot;He's been studying in the library lately. It looks
	like he's hoping to go to the Greenhill Academy.&quot;
